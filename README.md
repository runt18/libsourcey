# LibSourcey

**Homepage**: [http://sourcey.com/libsourcey](http://sourcey.com/libsourcey)  
**Licence**: LGPL
  
LibSourcey is a collection of open source cross platform C++11 modules and classes that provide developers with a flexible high performance arsenal for the rapid development of real-time messaging and live media streaming applications. 

LibSourcey is built on top of Node.js's underlying libuv library and utilises event-based asynchronous IO in to maximise performance and minimise concurrency reliance for building mission critical server-side applications. Modern C++11 design principles have been adhered to throughout for clear and readable code, and straighforward integration into existing projects.

For media streaming applications, LibSourcey provides a simple and flexible method of capturing live audio/video streams (_OpenCV/FFmpeg_), processing, filtering and encoding them using any video format (_FFmpeg_), and broadcasting the result over the Internet (_libuv_). This is made possible by implementing a thin layer over the top of some brilliant open source projects, such as FFmpeg, OpenCV and libuv. The only required third-party dependency is libuv, and that is included in the local source and compiled automatically. All others dependencies are optional. 

Unfortunately documentation still a little sparse at this point, but we hope to change that in the near future. Until then, _use the source, Luke!_, and we welcome all community contributions to LibSourcey in order to promote the development of better real-time native and web applications

LibSourcey provides full support for the following protocols: **TCP**, **SSL**, **UDP**, **HTTP**, **JSON**, **XML**, **STUN**, **SDP**, **SocketIO**.  
Partial support is provided for the following protocols: **WebSockets**, **TURN**, **ICE**, **RTP**, and **XMPP**.
 
## Dependencies

_Required_: libuv, CMake, C++11 compiler (GCC, Visual Studio, Xcode)  
_Optional_: FFmpeg (>= 2.8.3), OpenCV (>= 3.0), WebRTC, OpenSSL (>= 1.0.1g), RtAudio, JsonCpp

## Installation

### Installing on Linux

This guide has been written for Ubuntu 14.04, but installation is very simple and should be easily protable for most flavours of Linux.

First install the necessary dependencies:

~~~ bash 
sudo apt-get update

# required dependencies
apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config git openssl libssl-dev cmake libjack-jackd2-dev

# optional dependencies
apt-get install -y opencv-dev
~~~

_Note:_ To compile LibSourcey with video and streaming capabilities enabled you should install the latest versions of both FFmpeg and OpenCV. 

If you need to install FFmpeg, then you can use the official FFmpeg installation guide which works out of the box with LibSourcey: http://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu

Now checkout and compile the source:

~~~ bash 
cd ~/tmp
git clone https://github.com/sourcey/libsourcey.git
cd libsourcey
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE # extra cmake commands here...
make
sudo make install
~~~

Simple! [See here](#cmake-build-options) for a complete list of build options, and [here for examples](#examples).
